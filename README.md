To Dither your own image, add it to the /Images folder and set backgroundImage to "backgroundImage.src = 'Images/YOURIMAGE.png';" you may need to readjust cell size and spacing to fit your image to the canvas.
To add wave effects to the dithered image, replace the constant variables on lines 75-79 of index.js with the preset settings.
